<h3>The Giant Translator: A Multi Language Word Translator</h3>
It currently supports English, Spanish, French, and German
It is a simple easy to use program and can be used in many environments from education to work
When the program launches it compiles the data bank array and prompts the user what it wants to do
The user then chooses from translate, write, and print

If the user chooses to translate they will be prompted to enter a word in any supported language
After word the program prints out all translations of the word if it is in the databank
If the word is not in the databank it will inform the user of this

If the user chooses to write they will be prompted to enter a word in English
After doing so the user will be prompted to enter the words for the rest of the languages

If the user chooses to print the program will print out a table of the entire databank

After the program goes through the users initial choice it will prompt the user if it wishes to do something else,
or enter no to exit the program entirely
